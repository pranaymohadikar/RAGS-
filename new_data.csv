"Google Business Reviewshital meshramI want to change the EMI date of my loan account. I tried to change online, there is no way. Loan authority person says I have to visit the branch. Kamptee branch people said I have to come before 3 PM. According to icici people we will just sit at home and will work as per their schedule. Can’t icici help working people. Rather than helping and giving solution, icici returned the customer. Behaviour of branch manager and their employees are very rude. Would definitely prefer another bank from next time.when we required loan they call us like hundred time and for issue related to them they make customer to suffer.1NegativeFemale45184ICICI Bank Kamptee-Branch & ATMIN441002MaharashtraKampteeRani Kothi, Ground Floor, Police Lane, Jabalpur Nagpur Road, KampteeMaharashtraWestSemi UrbanBranch Staff BehaviourBranch Manager relatedbank+atm0"

My debit card expired and did not received renewal card even after one month so i visited there to get a solution. One person i think is the manager asked me whether I am using i mobile app i said yes he took my mobile and booking for a reissue debit card. I asked him why I have to purchase a new card when the card expired. He said that is the procedure and there is no other option. Whenever we lost a card we have to buy new one, but if near to expiry then normally they have send new card before the expiry. I asked him even after one month of expiry you have not sent card then how should we use the account if any emergency for that he is telling you should do alternative arrangements that means if we have icici account we should have other account and should not depend on icici as it may give hand at any point of time. So don't trust icici any more for emergency purposes. The way of handling the customer is not at all satisfactory.
